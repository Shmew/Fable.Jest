# Fable.ReactTestingLibrary

Fable.ReactTestingLibrary are bindings to use [react-testing-library]
and [user-event] to test Fable applications.

The library has been developed to follow the native API as 
closely as possible, while making some changes to allow for 
better discoverablity.

Fable.ReactTestingLibrary for the most part is exposed via `RTL`.

There are some additional types exposed in the main namespace.
However, these are all options used to provide input to `RTL`
functions, and will be noted where applicable.
