# FastCheck

FastCheck is the entry point to using most of the 
functionality of Fable.FastCheck. 

## FastCheck Options

Many of the functions below have overloads for `IFastCheckOptionsProperty list`, 
these are built using the `property` type:

```fsharp
type FastCheckOptions =
    /// Stop run on failure
    /// 
    /// It makes the run stop at the first encountered failure without shrinking.
    /// 
    /// When used in complement to `seed` and `path`,
    /// it replays only the minimal counterexample.
    endOnFailure: (value: bool)
        
    /// Custom values added at the beginning of generated ones
    /// 
    /// It enables users to come with examples they want to test at every run
    examples: (value: 'T list)
    
    /// Interrupt test execution after a given time limit: disabled by default
    /// 
    /// NOTE: Relies on `Date.now()`.
    /// 
    /// NOTE:
    /// Useful to avoid having too long running processes in your CI.
    ///
    /// Replay capability (see seed, path) can still be used if needed.
    /// 
    /// WARNING:
    /// If the test got interrupted before any failure occured
    /// and before it reached the requested number of runs specified by numRuns
    /// it will be marked as success. Except if markInterruptAsFailure as been 
    /// set to `true`
    interruptAfterTimeLimit: (value: int)

    /// Logger (see statistics): `console.log` by default
    logger: (value: string -> unit)

    /// Mark interrupted runs as failed runs: disabled by default
    markInterruptAsFailure: (value: bool)

    /// Maximal number of skipped values per run
    /// 
    /// Skipped is considered globally, so this value is used to compute maxSkips = 
    /// maxSkipsPerRun * numRuns.
    ///
    /// Runner will consider a run to have failed if it skipped maxSkips+1 times 
    /// before having generated numRuns valid entries.
    /// 
    /// See pre for more details on pre-conditions
    maxSkipsPerRun: (value: int)

    /// Number of runs before success: 100 by default
    numRuns: (value: int)

    /// Way to replay a failing property directly with the counterexample.

    /// (requires `seed` too).
    path: (value: string)

    /// Initial seed of the generator: `Date.now()` by default
    ///

    /// 
    /// In theory, seeds are supposed to be 32 bits integers.
    ///
    /// In case of double value, the seed will be rescaled into a 
    /// valid 32 bits integer (eg.: values between 0 and 1 will be evenly spread 
    /// into the range of possible seeds).
    seed: (value: float)

    /// Skip all runs after a given time limit: disabled by default
    /// 
    /// NOTE: Relies on `Date.now()`.
    /// 
    /// NOTE:
    /// Useful to stop too long shrinking processes.
    /// Replay capability (see seed, path) can resume the shrinking.
    /// 
    /// WARNING:
    /// It skips runs. Thus test might be marked as failed.
    /// Indeed, it might not reached the requested number of successful runs.
    skipAllAfterTimeLimit: (value: int)

    /// Maximum time in milliseconds for the predicate to answer: disabled by 
    /// default
    /// 
    /// WARNING: Only works for async code (see asyncProperty), will not 
    /// interrupt a synchronous code.
    timeout: (value: int)

    /// Force the use of unbiased arbitraries: biased by default
    unbiased: (value: bool)

module FastCheckOptions =
    /// Random generator is the core element behind the generation of random values 
    /// - changing it might directly impact the quality and performances of the 
    /// generation of random values.
    ///
    /// Default: xorshift128plus
    type randomType =
        congruential
        congruential32

    /// Set verbosity level.
    type verbose =
        none
        verbose
        veryVerbose
