# Arbitrary

Arbitrary is the interface that holds all the details needed
to generate the values for your tests:

```fsharp
type Random =
    /// Clone the random number generator
    clone: unit -> Random

    /// Generate an integer having `bits` random bits.
    next: bits: int -> int

    /// Generate a random boolean.
    nextBoolean: unit -> bool

    /// Generate a random integer (32 bits).
    nextInt: unit -> int

    /// Generate a random integer between min (included) and max (included).
    nextInt: min: int * max: int -> int

    /// Generate a random any between min (included) and max (included).
    nextBigInt: min: bigint * max: bigint -> bigint

    /// Generate a random floating point number between 0.0 (included) and 1.0 (excluded).
    nextDouble: unit -> float

/// A Shrinkable<'T> holds an internal value of type `'T`
/// and can shrink it to smaller values.
type Shrinkable<'T> =
    value_ : 'T

    shrink: unit -> seq<Shrinkable<'T>>

    /// State storing the result of hasCloneMethod.
    ///
    /// If true the value will be cloned each time it gets accessed.
    hasToBeCloned : bool

    /// Safe value of the shrinkable.
    ///
    /// Depending on hasToBeCloned it will either be value_ or a clone of it.
    value : 'T

    /// Create another shrinkable by mapping all values using the provided `mapper`
    ///
    /// Both the original value and the shrunk ones are impacted.
    map: mapper: ('T -> 'U) -> Shrinkable<'U>

    /// Create another shrinkable by filtering its shrunk values against a predicate.
    /// 
    /// Return true to keep the element, false otherwise.
    filter: predicate: ('T -> bool) -> Shrinkable<'T>

type Arbitrary<'T> =
    /// Generate a value of type `'T` along with its shrink method
    /// based on the provided random number generator.
    generate: mrng: Random -> Shrinkable<'T>

    /// Create another arbitrary by filtering values against a predicate.
    /// 
    /// Return true to keep the element, false otherwise.
    filter: predicate: ('T -> bool) -> Arbitrary<'T>

    /// Create another arbitrary by mapping all produced values using the provided mapper function.
    map: mapper: ('T -> 'U) -> Arbitrary<'U>

    /// Create another arbitrary by mapping a value from a base Arbirary using the fmapper function.
    [<Emit("$0.chain($1)")>]
    bind: fmapper: ('T -> Arbitrary<'U>) -> Arbitrary<'U>

    /// Create another Arbitrary with no shrink values.
    noShrink: unit -> Arbitrary<'T>

    /// Create another Arbitrary having bias - by default returns itself.
    withBias: freq: float -> Arbitrary<'T>

    /// Create another Arbitrary that cannot be biased.
    noBias: unit -> Arbitrary<'T>

type ArbitraryWithShrink<'T> =
    inherit Arbitrary<'T>

    /// Produce a stream of shrinks of value.
    shrink: value: 'T * ?shrunkOnce: bool -> seq<'T>

    /// Build the Shrinkable associated to value.
    shrinkableFor: value: 'T * ?shrunkOnce: bool -> Shrinkable<'T>
```

## auto

Attempts to auto generate arbitraries for a given type.

This is mostly intended for complex types that
would be very cumbersome to write an Arbitrary for.

Signature:
```fsharp
unit -> Arbitrary<'T>
```

Usage:
```fsharp
type MyDU =
    | Empty
    | SingleValue of int
    | Record of RecordTest
    | Function of (int -> string)

Arbitrary.auto<MyDU>()
